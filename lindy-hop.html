      <p>In the beginning (the late 1920s), there was a man named <a class="ulink" href="http://www.frankiemanning.com/" target="_top">Frankie Manning</a>. Frankie
      said unto his friends: dance. Jazz music had swung through the United
      States. <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop" target="_top">The Lindy
      Hop</a> was the buzz of the towns. People were happy, except for one
      thing...</p>
      <p>At the large dance halls, such as the <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Ballroom" target="_top">Savoy
      Ballroom</a>, there were ropes that divided the black dancers from
      the white dancers. The trouble with dancers is that they are often young
      and rebellious. The white women wanted to dance with everyone. Studs.
      The black men wanted to dance with everyone. Sluts. The white men
      couldn’t dance. The black women stood around looking hot. The trouble
      was that these people didn’t see ethnicity. They heard only the music;
      in their hearts they only wanted to swing-out with another person. Skin
      color didn’t matter; so why the ropes?</p>
      <p>Quite quickly, the ropes were jumped. Black and white people
      danced with one another: the walls of segregation started to splinter.
      Since then, Lindy Hop has enlivened social scenes, introduced
      prospective lovers, financially supported musicians, given people a fun
      reason to exercise, formed compassionate communities, taught humility,
      put smiles on faces around the world, and held fundraisers for worthy
      causes. Lindy Hoppers also rebelled against Nazis.</p>

      <p>Texas is big, religious, and has government-sanctioned death.
      Bibles describe situations where taking a person's life is just
      punishment. When communities glean morality from a book that glorifies
      revenge, they become indiscriminate, amoral zombies.</p>
      <p>In 1991, Todd Willingham, not the most honorable man, was
      sentenced to die for burning his house and three children. Critically,
      in 2004, just four days before Willingham’s scheduled death by
      injection, renown arson expert and chemist Dr. Gerald Hurst submitted a
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/37712737/Gerald-Hurst-s-Report-on-Todd-Willingham-Arson-Investigation" target="_top">report</a>
      regarding the evidence:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>The fire investigation report of the Texas State Fire Marshal’s
        Office in this case is a remarkable document. On first reading, a
        contemporary fire origin and cause analyst might well wonder how
        anyone could make so many critical errors in interpreting the
        evidence. However, when the report is looked at in the context of its
        time and in light of a few key advances that have been made in the
        fire investigation field in the last dozen years, it becomes obvious
        that the report more or less simply reflects the shortcomings in the
        state of the art prior to the beginning of serious efforts to
        introduce standards and to test old theories that had previously been
        accepted on faith.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>The original evidence for arson was invalid. Todd Willingham was
      innocent. Yet Governor Rick Perry denied a stay of execution. At 6:20pm
      on February 17th, 2004, the United States government and the Texas
      Governor knowingly authorized the murder of an innocent man. On faith
      and superstition.</p>

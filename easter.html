      <p>Easter is yet another Christian theft of ideas from other cultures
      to ease indoctrinating non-Christians. The word Easter is actually
      linked to the Pagan goddess Eostre, and the celebration of warm sunshine
      and newborn babies. Originally, rabbits and hares were a symbol of
      fertility, due to how quickly they reproduced. Thus the Easter Bunny was
      conceived.</p>
      <p>There was no resurrection. Miracles have never been proven under
      any scientific test, and break the laws of known physics. Apologetics
      argue that miracles are the work of God, but that presupposes that God
      exists. There is insufficient evidence that any gods exist. Miracles
      cannot be used as evidence because it leads to a circular argument: God
      creates miracles; miracles prove God exists. And blue balls are blue
      because they are blue.</p>
      <p>The history of Easter eggs extends back to the ancient Egyptians
      and Persians, who also enjoyed coloring and then eating eggs during
      spring. Christians thought they would make a marvellous representation
      of Christ’s tomb.</p>
      <p>Easter itself is only mentioned in the King James translation of
      The Holy Bible (Acts 12:4), which is a mistranslation of
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Passover</em></span>.</p>

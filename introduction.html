      <p>Why question beliefs? Why come to your own conclusions?</p>
      <p>Unjustified beliefs, while seemingly harmless, can promote
      widespread ignorance, hatred, malice, and violence. For example, Muslims
      believe their god deems bikinis an improprietous no-no. For this, 215
      people were <a class="ulink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/23/newsid_3226000/3226740.stm" target="_top">murdered</a>
      in riots, sparked by the 2002 Miss World Pageant, which was to be hosted
      in Nigeria's Abuja.</p>
      <p>Unquestioned beliefs stifle progress and place humanity in peril.
      Squelching freedom to express or consider uncomfortable ideas attacks
      the acquisition and distribution of knowledge.</p>
      <p>Galileo's celestial observations contradicted literal biblical
      interpretation. His findings were <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair" target="_top">suppressed</a>
      under threat of torture. We know now that asteroids, gamma rays,
      supermassive <a class="ulink" href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/12_releases/press_060412.html" target="_top">black
      holes</a>, halogenated hydrocarbons, <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megacaldera" target="_top">megacaldera</a>, ice
      ages, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.physorg.com/news186920485.html" target="_top">methane</a>
      destabilization, and over-exploiting resources could extinguish all life
      on Earth. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1924985/" target="_top">Praying</a>
      will not abate these threats.</p>
      <p>Time is our most precious commodity; <a class="ulink" href="http://richardcarrier.blogspot.ca/2006/11/science-and-medieval-christianity.html" target="_top">arresting
      advancement</a> or dissemination of knowledge is an intolerable
      transgression.</p>
      <p>Yet <span class="bold"><strong>science does not answer
      everything</strong></span>. The scientific method is a tool to discover how
      the Universe works. Science continually refines insights based on new
      findings; whereas, belief requires discarding new information to
      preserve faith.</p>
      <p>This book contains commentary on many topics that religious people
      preach from misunderstanding. This cognitive gap must be filled for it
      is inherently harmful to believe falsehoods, worse still to pass
      ignorance on to the next generation. It is axiomatic that the
      propagation of lies is detrimental to survival.</p>
      <p>Religion snakes into science classes, marries politics, and guides
      formulation of laws. Adherents bombard their beliefs upon others in many
      ways (gods in constitutions, gods on currency, gods in anthems, swearing
      on bibles, and crosses on motorways), protect child molesters, are
      anti-homosexual, cause third-world conflicts, condemn condoms, and
      promote misogyny. Such evil must stop.</p>
      <p>Keep this book with you. Keep a copy on your laptop. Distribute it
      to friends. Use it to refute the Bible. Refer to it when friends and
      family members ask questions. Understand arguments, learn about logical
      fallacies, and grow as a good, kind, and moral free-thinking individual.

      <p><span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory" target="_top">Scientific
      Theory</a></em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>hypothesis</em></span>, and
      <span class="emphasis"><em>theory</em></span> are closely related terms that are easily
      confused. The word <span class="emphasis"><em>blue</em></span>, for example, can mean
      either <span class="emphasis"><em>sad</em></span> or a <span class="emphasis"><em>color</em></span>. If I
      said my eyes were blue, unless you enjoyed puns, you probably would not
      think that my eyes were sad. Mixing two definitions is called
      <span class="emphasis"><em>equivocation</em></span>.</p>
      <p><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation" target="_top">Equivocation</a> can
      be difficult to notice. For example, faith that a chair will support
      weight is using the word <span class="emphasis"><em>faith</em></span> in the sense of,
      “Based on my knowledge of physics and my previous experiences, I
      believe...”; whereas, the word <span class="emphasis"><em>faith</em></span> can also mean,
      “Even though there is no evidence, and I'm lying through my teeth, I
      believe...” Do not confuse the two definitions. Having “faith in the
      physical attributes of a chair” and “faith in a god“ are not equivalent
      definitions of faith.</p>
      <p>A Scientific Theory, such as the <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" target="_top">Theory of
      Evolution</a>, is different than a theory that is a hunch or a
      guess. A Scientific Theory has been tested, often many times (in many
      ways) by many different people, and observations have been consistently
      verified. Scientific Theories are also reviewed by peers to make sure
      that scientists are accurately reporting their results and that their
      experiments are conducted using scientifically valid methods.</p>
      <p>Scientific Theories also allow us to make and test
      predictions.</p>

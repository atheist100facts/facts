      <p>The <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Temple" target="_top">People’s
      Temple</a>, founded in 1955 by an Indianapolis preacher named James
      Warren Jones (who lacked formal theological training and thought himself
      a prophet) asked his congregation to move with him to Guyana, in South
      America. By 1977, his cult of 1200 people lived under his
      socio-communistic regime in Jonestown.</p>
      <p>Concerned cult member relatives asked the United States government
      to investigate and intervene.</p>
      <p>In late 1978, U.S. Congressman Leo Ryan visited Jonestown, but
      violent threats ended his trip early. While boarding the plane,
      Jonestown guards shot at Ryan, killing him and four others; a few people
      escaped the slaughter. Once Jones learned of the escape, he convinced
      cult members that the government would retaliate by taking away and then
      torturing their children and seniors. Jones “foresaw” they had no
      recourse but suicide.</p>
      <p>Parents subsequently fed their children a mix of tranquilizers,
      sedatives, and cyanide. Most adults followed suit, concluding with
      <span class="bold"><strong>918 deaths</strong></span>, including those who were
      shot.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">
          <strong>Cult and religious power must be restricted
      or eliminated.</strong>

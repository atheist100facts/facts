      <p><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" target="_top">Bertrand
      Russell</a>, who was intentionally raised agnostic, was strongly
      influenced by Exodus 23:2: “You shall not follow the masses in doing
      evil.” The passage concludes, “nor shall you testify in a dispute so as
      to turn aside after a multitude in order to pervert justice.”</p>
      <p>Would that everyone wholly subscribe to such tenets! Sadly such
      biblical diamonds are lost betwixt the mire of passages such as Jeremiah
      50:21: "Pursue, kill, and completely destroy them, as I have commanded
      you.”</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Russell subscribed to a positive, enriching world
      view. In 1952, Russell <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cfpf.org.uk/articles/religion/br/br_god.html" target="_top">wrote a
      passage</a> similar to the following:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>If I were to suggest that orbiting the Sun between the Earth and
        Mars there exists a remarkably tiny comet containing a pink sapphire
        vein, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were to
        add that the comet is too small to be detected even by our most
        powerful telescopes. But if I were to insist that, since my assertion
        cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of
        human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking
        nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a comet were affirmed in
        ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled
        into the minds of children, hesitation to believe in its existence
        would be deemed eccentric and the doubter, undoubtedly, ushered into
        psychiatric care.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>Be wary of the lure of widespread belief for it easily
      ensnares.</p>

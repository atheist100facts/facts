      <p>In 1633, <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_top">Galileo</a> was
      sentenced to house arrest (for the remainder of his life) by the
      Catholic Church for daring to suggest an idea. Yes, an idea. An idea
      that the Church didn’t like: that the Earth revolves around the Sun.
      This idea is called <span class="emphasis"><em>heliocentrism</em></span>. They locked him
      up and banned reprinting his works; they <a class="ulink" href="http://www1.umn.edu/ships/galileo/library/1616docs.htm" target="_top">forced
      him</a> to recant his position or <a class="ulink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Copernicus-Adventures-Astronomical-History/dp/0521326885/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326304382&amp;sr=8-12#reader_0521326885" target="_top">face
      torture</a>. The Catholic Church <a class="ulink" href="http://www.catholic.com/tracts/the-galileo-controversy" target="_top">suppresses
      information</a> because the truth would allow people to conclude
      that their teachings are false.</p>
      <p>In 1741, the Pope graciously allowed publication of Galileo’s
      complete scientific works. That they had to get permission is appalling.
      By 1835, official opposition to heliocentrism was dropped. Through
      Galileo's work, rationality and reason were thrust into public
      consciousness once more.</p>
      <p>The Catholic Church made a <a class="ulink" href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~nmcenter/sci-cp/sci-9211.html" target="_top">half-assed
      apology</a> in late 1992.</p>
      <p>The Pontifical Academy even planned to build a statue of Galileo
      within the Vatican. A month later the plans were halted. Probably
      because they needed the money to shuttle fiddly priests around, or
      perhaps to buy bigger hard-drives for their child pr0n stash.</p>

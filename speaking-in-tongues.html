      <p>Languages let you express your thoughts so that other people can
      understand you. Read the following sentence aloud:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>Our universe exists without meddling, omnipotent, omniscient
        entities.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>Now read it aloud again. Putting aside that repetition is a form
      of brainwashing, chances are that you made very similar sounds both
      times. When people <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossolalia" target="_top">speak in tongues</a>,
      the phrase, “Our universe exists without meddling, omnipotent,
      omniscient entities,” in their supposedly supernatural language won’t
      sound the same twice. The reason is because they are making it up, just
      like everyone else who claims to talk in meaningful gibberish.</p>
      <p>Try it: record them on your cell phone and play it back.</p>
      <p>Peer pressure is interesting. If everybody around you is doing
      something, it becomes socially awkward to buck the trend. The <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor's_New_Clothes" target="_top">Emperor's
      New Clothes</a> is a great tale of such an incident. It took a young
      boy to courageously tell the Emperor of the tailor's joke: the Emperor
      was riding completely nude through the city streets. At that point,
      everyone started laughing and pointing at the Emperor. (Not a nice thing
      to do, mind you!)</p>
      <p>Speaking in tongues is a lie to yourself and a lie to
      others.</p>

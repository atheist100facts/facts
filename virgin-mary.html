      <p>Here is what one book has to say about
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Maryām</em></span>:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>While we’ll never be perfect like Mary, our pursuit of Christ
        should lead us to saintliness like hers: rooted in humility, trust,
        service and love.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>There is no such thing as a perfect human. The idea of perfection
      is like the notion of beauty. Everyone has opinions about what is
      beautiful. A perfect human would live for ten thousand years without
      serious ailment or injury, ace every school test ever given, be
      physically symmetrical from head to toe, and have six fully functional
      fingers on both hands and six fully functional toes on both feet. The
      concept of perfection is itself flawed.</p>
      <p>Beyond biblical accounts, and a few other early Christian sources,
      there is no independently verifiable information about any aspect of her
      life.</p>
      <p>The story of Mary’s perfection (her humility, trust, service, and
      love) is vulgar. Mary was impregnated, possibly against her will, and
      was praised because she accepted and endured her fate with humility.
      Hearken, ye women: accept being raped for it is the will of God.</p>

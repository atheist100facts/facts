      <p>Corinthians 14:34-35 reads, “Let your women keep silent in the
      churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be
      submissive, as the law also says. And if they want to learn something,
      let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to
      speak in church.”</p>
      <p>This progressive attitude and traditional interpretation of the
      Bible has kept women out of priesthood for centuries. Some people still
      think that women are not permitted to be priests (or ministers) because,
      according to Genesis, they were not created for that purpose. Others
      insist that it should not happen because it has not yet happened. Try to
      wrap your mind around that illogical buckshot. Perhaps they were smoking
      weed when coming up with such iron-clad reasoning.</p>
      <p>Or perhaps the Catholic Church is a male dominated patriarchy
      unwilling to yield its financial power to the gender that would be most
      likely to protect youth from harm? That’s not to say that all men want
      to molest little children and all women are pure of heart. There are
      male ordained Catholic priests who believe all forms of child abuse
      should be stopped. It would certainly be nice if more of them shared the
      names of known child rapists with the police; and nicer still if
      whomever is appointed to protect the children wasn't also guilty of
      manufacturing child pornography.</p>

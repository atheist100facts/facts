      <p><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_top">Alan
      Turing</a> was instrumental in saving the British from the Germans.
      He was the Father of computer science, a codebreaker, a mathematician,
      and the victim of <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Conviction_for_indecency" target="_top">religious
      prejudice</a> for being homosexual. It is bitterly unjust that a man
      so important to the freedom of his fellow citizens should have had their
      laws used against him. Laws he so ardently sought to protect.</p>
      <p>Such is the power of religious propaganda and dogma. Some
      religions teach that there is no middle ground: no room for exceptions.
      This strict regime of right versus wrong is too inflexible, too archaic
      for a progressive civilization. Stealing is usually wrong (like taking
      money from your parents without their express permission), but sometimes
      stealing can be the only action (like lifting documents from a priest’s
      office that provide evidence of rampant corruption and child
      abuse).</p>
      <p>Turing was given a choice: go to jail or suffer <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration" target="_top">chemical
      castration</a>. He chose the latter, to his physical detriment. Two
      years after his sentence, Turing was found dead from cyanide poisoning,
      most likely having taken his own life by biting into a poisoned
      apple.</p>
      <p>The <a class="ulink" href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/40342" target="_top">Prime Minister
      apologized</a> in 2009. A symbolic gesture not for Alan Turing, but
      to admit that the religion-influenced society was wrong in persecuting
      homosexuals.</p>

      <p><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_top">Stephen
      Hawking</a> has been misrepresented to support the baseless position
      that certain gods exist. Even though this is an Appeal to Authority
      fallacy, his book <span class="emphasis"><em>The Grand Design</em></span> clarifies that
      he does not believe in a personal god. Hawking also regards Heaven as
      mythical:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49
        years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so
        much I want to do first. I regard the brain as a computer which will
        stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife
        for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of
        the dark.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>In 2010, Hawking contrasted religion and science by noting their
      fundamental differences. Religion is based on authority (imposed dogma
      and faith), while science is based on observation (reason and
      rationality). Science will trounce religion, he declared, because it
      works.</p>
      <p>Without medical science, Hawking would have succumbed to
      <span class="emphasis"><em>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</em></span>, also known as Lou
      Gehrig's disease. And yet countless numbers of people have died from
      disease. How many of those people could have reshaped the world for the
      better had they lived a full life? Now consider how much money is wasted
      on religious propaganda that could be used to advance medical
      science.</p>
      <p>Religion affronts all of humanity in many ways.</p>

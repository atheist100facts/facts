      <p>For guys, the tip (or “head”) of the penis is the hot spot of male
      pleasure, with many sensitive nerve endings craving attention. Stimulate
      the penis, especially the head, and an orgasm results. Then sleep.
      Nearly all males are born with the head of their penis surrounded by
      protective flesh called the foreskin. When aroused, the foreskin pulls
      back, exposing the tip of the penis.</p>
      <p>For gals, the clitoris (or “clit”) is the hot spot of female
      pleasure, with many, many sensitive nerve endings desiring attention.
      Stimulate the clitoris and an orgasm often results. Then cuddling. The
      end of the clitoris is usually tiny (cribbage peg-sized), which can make
      it difficult to find at first. Nearly all females are born with the
      clitoris covered by the clitoral hood (for protection). Arousal tends to
      poke the clitoris a little bit beyond its hood.</p>
      <p>Orgasms are amazing because humans evolved that way. If sex was
      extremely painful or damaging, we wouldn’t do it as often. Less sex
      means fewer pregnancies, which leads to extinction.</p>
      <p>Some religions require slicing off the foreskin at birth; other
      religions require cutting off the clitoris at birth. Removing the
      clitoris makes it practically impossible for a woman to experience
      sexual pleasure through orgasms. Removing the foreskin makes the head of
      the penis less sensitive. Both of these actions are forms of <span class="bold"><strong>genital mutilation</strong></span>.</p>

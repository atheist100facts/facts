      <p>Child abuse is the emotional, physical, or sexual mistreatment of
      children. This could include neglect or improper care.</p>
      <p>Catholic priests, for example, are known to molest children, yet
      rather than admit to it and seek professional psychiatric care (because
      rape, unlike homosexuality, is morally and ethically wrong), those
      reprehensible priests ask the Pope to cover up their despicable,
      deplorable actions. For a time, the papacy instituted a policy of
      reporting incidents to secular authorities, however this was almost
      never followed in practice.</p>
      <p>Popes have an <a class="ulink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ1_aQz6IuU" target="_top">impeccable
      record</a> of not reporting child abuse, often only reporting the
      abuse years afterwards, and generally only if it is believed that the
      rapist will otherwise be exposed. This makes the Pope—and anyone else
      who has harbored or helped assailants escape legal
      prosecution—equivalent to child abuser by association. As guilty and
      spineless as rapists themselves.</p>
      <p>Never trust anyone who belongs to a community that hides the truth
      about such foul, harmful, menacing deeds. If they can hide the truth
      about these heinous of crimes, how easy would it be for them to lie
      about other, lesser matters?</p>

      <p>We are fortunate that this <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" target="_top">renown astronomer</a>
      lived in an era where he could freely express his ideas without fear of
      being burned alive. His <a class="ulink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luAteAz3WQ0" target="_top">poignant words</a>
      have the cold, sharp, refreshing splash of clarity and honest
      insight:</p>

          <p>I maintain there is much more wonder in science than in
        pseudoscience. And in addition, to whatever measure this term has any
        meaning, science has the additional virtue, and it is not an
        inconsiderable one, of being true.</p>

          <p>Think of how many religions attempt to validate themselves with
        prophecy. Think of how many people rely on these prophecies, however
        vague, however unfulfilled, to support or prop up their beliefs. Yet
        has there ever been a religion with the prophetic accuracy and
        reliability of science?</p>

          <p>Finding the occasional straw of truth awash in a great ocean of
        confusion and bamboozle requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication
        and courage. But if we don't practice these tough habits of thought,
        we cannot hope to solve the truly serious problems that face us – and
        we risk becoming a nation of suckers, up for grabs by the next
        charlatan who comes along.</p>

          <p>One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we've been
        bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the
        bamboozle. We're no longer interested in finding out the truth. The
        bamboozle has captured us. it is simply too painful to
        acknowledge—even to ourselves—that we've been so credulous. (So the
        old bamboozles tend to persist as the new bamboozles rise.)</p>

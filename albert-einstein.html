      <p><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_top">Albert
      Einstein</a> proposed a revolutionary idea about space, time, and
      light. He even hammered on intolerant atheists.</p>
      <p>He once <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_top">wrote</a>:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>A man who is convinced of the truth of his religion is indeed
        never tolerant. At the least, he is to feel pity for the adherent of
        another religion but usually it does not stop there. The faithful
        adherent of a religion will try first of all to convince those that
        believe in another religion and usually he goes on to hatred if he is
        not successful. However, hatred then leads to persecution when the
        might of the majority is behind it.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>He also <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_top">wrote</a>:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>I was barked at by numerous dogs who are earning their food
        guarding ignorance and superstition for the benefit of those who
        profit from it. Then there are the fanatical atheists whose
        intolerance is of the same kind as the intolerance of the religious
        fanatics and comes from the same source. They are like slaves who are
        still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off
        after hard struggle.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>And he <a class="ulink" href="http://talentdevelop.com/interviews/mfriedel.html" target="_top">wrote</a>:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>I am convinced that some political and social activities and
        practices of the Catholic organizations are detrimental and even
        dangerous for the community as a whole, here and everywhere. I mention
        here only the fight against birth control at a time when
        overpopulation in various countries has become a serious threat to the
        health of people and a grave obstacle to any attempt to organize peace
        on this planet.</p>

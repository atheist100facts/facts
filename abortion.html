      <p>An abortion is a pregnancy that is terminated before the fetus can
      survive outside the womb. For a large part of its history, the Catholic
      Church did not regard early term abortions as sinful.</p>
      <p>In the book <a class="ulink" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/" target="_top">
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Freakonomics</em></span></a>, the authors showed that
      giving women the ability to choose when to bring a baby into the world
      results in lower crime rates. The reason is that young adults (in their
      twenties) in lower socioeconomic classes are more likely to commit
      crimes. When women of this class have abortions, they reduce the number
      of potential criminals. Twenty years after the legalization of abortion,
      crime waves that were predicted never materialized.</p>
      <p>Some religious people claim abortions are unacceptable for
      biblical reasons; some religions preach that miscarriages are abortions.
      In both cases, rational thought and reason is ignored in favor of
      superstition and fallacious <a class="ulink" href="http://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/appeals/appeal-to-tradition/" target="_top">appeals

      <p>As of 2010, <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth" target="_top">statistically
      speaking</a>, 24 weeks is the earliest age a fetus from a preterm
      birth has a greater than 50% chance of survival. An infant born in the
      23rd or 24th week of gestation has a 16% chance of survival and 64%
      chance of serious disability (such as brain damage and
      blindness).</p>

      Taylor</a> is reported as being born (on October 24th, 2006) after
      21 weeks and 6 days. However, when her gestation period is calculated
      using the more common method—her mother's last menstrual period—she is
      no longer a statistical anomaly. Amillia was born after 23 weeks and 6
      days of gestation; she is healthy.</p>
      <p>The earliest premature baby in the world was born after 21 weeks
      and 5 days in gestation. <a class="ulink" href="http://www.canada.com/topics/bodyandhealth/story.html?id=db8f33ab-33e9-429f-bedc-b6ca80f61bdc" target="_top">James

      <p>Atheists are sometimes said to be Satanists. However, atheists
      reject Satan just as they reject all gods, demons, and imaginary
      animals. Only people who actually believe in Satan can qualify as
      Satanists. (Those people also happen to believe in gods.)</p>
      <p>Modern public practice of Satanism began in 1966, when the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.churchofsatan.com/" target="_top">Church of Satan</a> was founded
      by Howard Stanton Levey (later Anton LaVey). Surprisingly, the two major
      trends were Theistic and Atheistic Satanism. We can chuckle at Theistic
      Satanists for their worship of Satan as a real supernatural deity. The
      Atheistic flavors idolize Satan in a symbolic sense.</p>
      <p><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism" target="_top">LaVeyan
      Satanism</a>, the most well-known worship, is based on
      individualism, self-control, and revenge mentality. Adherents consider
      themselves truth-seekers, skeptics, and adversaries of religion. Peter
      Gilmore, a Church of Satan leader, notes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p>Satanists do not believe in the supernatural, in neither God nor
        the Devil. To the Satanist, he is his own God. [...] Satan is not a
        conscious entity to be worshipped, rather a reservoir of power inside
        each human to be tapped at will. Thus any concept of sacrifice is
        rejected as a Christian aberration—in Satanism there’s no deity to
        which one can sacrifice.</p>
        </blockquote>

      <p>They also believe in magic, which seats them decisively on the
      couch of hypocritical <a class="ulink" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=loopy%20loo" target="_top">loopy-loos</a>.</p>
